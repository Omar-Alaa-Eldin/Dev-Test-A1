# Test Project Overview

## 1. BDD Scenarios

- Open `.feature` files for Cucumber BDD scenarios
- Review `sign-up&contact-use_BDD.txt` for behavior-driven test cases
- Execute BDD tests using Cucumber framework

## 2. Test Coverage

| Test Type | Scope | Tools Used |
|---|---|---|
| Manual UI Testing | Functional, Integration, UAT | Manual execution, BDD scenarios |
| API Testing | REST API validation, Endpoints | Postman, Newman |
| Automation Testing | Regression, Smoke, Functional | Selenium, TestNG, Maven |
| Database Testing | Data integrity, Validation | SQL queries, DB validations |

## 3. Evidence & Traceability

- **Evidence Folder**: `Evidence/` folder contains test execution proofs and screenshots
- **Traceability Matrix**: `Traceability_Matrix/` maps requirements to test cases
- **Defect Tracking**: All defects tracked in `Bug_Reports_Export.xlsx`
- **Reporting**: Comprehensive reporting in `Text_Reports/` and `Reports/` directories

## 4. Project Team

| Role | Identifier | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| QA Team | CAI3_SWD6_G5_Team4 | Test execution, automation, reporting |
| Project | Automation Exercise Website Testing | End-to-end testing |
| Phase | Comprehensive Test Cycle | Full test coverage |

## 5. Updates & Maintenance

### Version Control

- Update test cases when new features are added
- Maintain traceability matrix with requirement changes
- Version control for all test artifacts

### Maintenance Tasks

- Regularly update automation scripts for UI changes
- Keep Postman collections synchronized with API updates
- Refresh test data and environments as needed
- Update documentation with new findings and changes

### Best Practices

- Follow naming conventions for test files
- Document all test changes in reports
- Maintain evidence for all test executions
- Regular review and update of test strategy

## 6. Support

- **Test execution**: Review test strategy and documentation
- **Technical issues**: Check automation framework setup in `pom.xml`
- **API testing**: Refer to Postman collections and global configurations
- **Reporting**: Examine reports in `Text_Reports/` and `Reports/` directories
